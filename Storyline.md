#Legend of Logoro Storyline

In the distant reaches of the universe lies a galaxy teeming with magical energy and mathematical mysteries. The inhabitants of this galaxy, known as the Mathematicians, have long safeguarded the secrets of mathematics, using its power to maintain balance and order across the cosmos.

But trouble brews when an ancient artifact known as the Prism of Equations is shattered, scattering its fragments across five distant planets. Without the Prism's power, chaos begins to spread, threatening the very fabric of reality.

Amidst this turmoil, a young apprentice mathematician from South Sudan receives a mysterious summons. Guided by a magical mentor named Professor Puzzler, the apprentice embarks on a cosmic journey to restore the Prism of Equations and save the galaxy.

##Planet 1: Mathania (Addition)

The journey begins on Mathania, a planet where equations flourish within enchanted arrays of addition. The apprentice encounters friendly locals who task them with solving addition-themed puzzles, earning points to unlock the first fragment of the Prism. Along the way, they acquire their first wand, the Addition Wand, capable of adding with speed and precision.

##Planet 2: Subtractus (Subtraction)

Next, the apprentice travels to Subtractus, a planet where numbers drift amid subtractive mists. Side missions here challenge the player to solve subtraction-themed puzzles, unlocking the powers of the Subtraction Wand, allowing them to subtract with precision and finesse.

##Planet 3: Multiplya (Multiplication)

Multiplya awaits, a realm of multiplying marvels and expansive arrays. To progress, the apprentice must tackle multiplication-themed missions, unlocking the Multiplication Wand's ability to multiply with speed and accuracy.

##Planet 4: Dividia (Division)

On the planet Dividia, the challenges grow more divided as the apprentice faces division dilemmas and fractional foes. With the Division Wand in hand, they harness the power of division to overcome obstacles and earn the fourth fragment of the Prism.

##Planet 5: Operationaria (Combination of all operations)

Finally, the apprentice reaches the mysterious planet of Operationaria, where equations blend and intertwine in a complex dance of mathematical operations. Here, they must confront the ultimate test of mathematical prowess, facing off against the formidable Boss of Equations in a battle of wit and skill, combining all aspects of BEDMAS they've mastered along the way.
